    :note [ :quote "The logical structure of such facts is that of the declarative speech act, in which language users collectively grant a person or object particular social powers. Social institutions arise because people can impose so-called status functions, involving particular rights and obligations, on individuals or objects. Thus, they can impose value on pieces of paper or metal by accepting them as money. More specifically, these institutions are brought about by constitutive rules of the form “X counts as Y in context C”; in the context of soccer, getting the ball in the opposite team’s net counts as a goal. Put differently, soccer is not an independently existing activity guided by regulative rules; it is actually constituted by its rules.";
